The internet is the best place to learn data visualization.

## Resources I used for this talk

Below are some good references for learning more about data visualization principles:

* Rafael Irizarry's ["Introduction to Data Science" book](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/):
    * [Chapter 7](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/introduction-to-data-visualization.html): Introduction to data visualization
    * [Chapter 9](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html): Visualizing data distributions
    * [Chapter 11](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/data-visualization-principles.html): "Data visualization principles"

This resource also relies heavily on:

* Peter Aldhous's ["Introduction to Data Visualization" course](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/index.html), especially the ["Data visualization: basic principles"](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html) section, and
* A [talk by Karl Broman](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2017.pdf), which doesn't have much explanatory text but makes sense if you ask yourself "which one is easier to understand?" on each slide.

## Other online resources to learn about visualizing data

The best way to learn about data visualization principles is to see many examples of good visualizations. Twitter is a great place to learn about these, as are the following resources:

* Flowing Data
* The Pudding
* DataScienceWeekly

Also pay attention to beautiful visualizations in online news (e.g. FiveThirtyEight, NY Times).
