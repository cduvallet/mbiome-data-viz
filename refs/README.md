The internet is the best place to learn data visualization.

## Resources I used for this talk

Below are some good references for learning more about data visualization principles:

* Rafael Irizarry's ["Introduction to Data Science" book](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/):
    * [Chapter 7](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/introduction-to-data-visualization.html): Introduction to data visualization
    * [Chapter 9](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/distributions.html): Visualizing data distributions
    * [Chapter 11](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/data-visualization-principles.html): "Data visualization principles"

This resource also relies heavily on:

* Peter Aldhous's ["Introduction to Data Visualization" course](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/index.html), especially the ["Data visualization: basic principles"](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week2.html) section, and
* A [talk by Karl Broman](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2017.pdf), which doesn't have much explanatory text but makes sense if you ask yourself "which one is easier to understand?" on each slide.

## MIT BE Communication Lab

The [Communication Lab in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/) is an incredible resource to learn about communicating your science to different audiences. They have a "[CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/use-the-commkit/)" with lots of concise guides for different scientific communication needs.

I especially like their [article on figures](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/commkit/figure-design/), which was one of the first times I was presented with the huge difference between designing figures for papers vs. presentations.

They recently launched an online resource kit on GitHub. The exact organizational structure may change, but for now check out the [main repo](https://github.com/MIT-BECL/awesome-becl-resources) for links to lots of cool resources, including many on data visualization!

## Other online resources to learn about visualizing data

The best way to learn about data visualization principles is to see many examples of good visualizations. Twitter is a great place to learn about these, as are the following resources:

* Flowing Data
* The Pudding
* DataScienceWeekly

Also pay attention to beautiful visualizations in online news (e.g. FiveThirtyEight, NY Times). In general I think data-driven journalists are leading the charge in the data viz world, so if you follow that world plus your computing world of interest (e.g. [#Rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats)) you will learn an incredible amount.

Otherwise, there are many online resources. For example:

* "[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)" by Claus O. Wilke, a free online book written in R    
* [The Data Visualisation catalog](https://datavizcatalogue.com/), which can help you interactively figure out which type of viz you could use     
* "[From data to viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)", a similar resource
