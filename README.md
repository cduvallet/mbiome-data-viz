# Looking at your data: tips for microbiome data visualization

This is a talk I gave at the April 2019 [Microbiome Hackathon](www.microbiomehack.org) at Cornell University, hosted by [Ilana Brito](https://www.britolab.org/).

You can see the talk at [cduvallet.github.io/mbiome-data-viz/](https://cduvallet.github.io/mbiome-data-viz/).

This talk is structured in three parts, all united around the theme of "looking at your data" (arguably the most important part of any data analysis!):

1. Looking at your raw data
2. Exploring your data
3. Visualizing your results

There are pretty standard ways to do #1 and 2, but #3 has an infinite number of possibilities. The amount of detail I present in each section is thus tailored accordingly.

# Technicalities

This talk is actually just one [markdown file](docs/data-viz-talk.md), which is converted by reveal.js into a fancy-looking presentation.

I copied the files in this repo from a [previous reveal presentation I made](https://cduvallet.github.io/phdchat-philosophies/), which itself relied heavily on [Christian Deiner](https://github.com/cdiener)'s [example presentation](https://github.com/Gibbons-Lab/ccmb_workshop).

Check out the README from my [previous presentation](https://github.com/cduvallet/phdchat-philosophies) for more details on the technical stuff.
